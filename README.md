# A Brief Python Tutorial using Jupyter.

This repository contain material and instructions from the following sources
 - "IPython and Jupyter in Depth: High productivity, interactive Python" tutorial taught during PyCon 2019.
 - CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition taught at Stanford

## Accessing Jupyter Notebooks on Bridges

Source: Jay Alameda's slides in the Student Folder for Advanced Computing for Social Change.

The steps required (abbreviated):

1. Reset password for PSC (https://apr.psc.edu/) with XSEDE username and associated email.
2. Visit Bridges OnDemand (https://ondemand.bridges2.psc.edu/) and log-in.
3. From the toolbar at the top: Interactive Apps > Jupyter Notebook
4. Configure the number of hours, nodes, account, etc.
5. Click "Launch".
6. Once the file manager is up and running you can upload some of the notebooks (extension `.ipynb`) from this project to Bridges.

## A Case Study on BRFSS Dataset

I also provide an additional `.ipynb` on the 2016 BRFSS Dataset from the CDC.
